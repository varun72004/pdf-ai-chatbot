Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

| Variable | Description | Default | Required |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Your OpenAI API key for LLM inference | — | ✅ |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | OpenAI model to use for chat completions | `gpt-4o-mini` | ❌ |
| `CHUNK_SIZE` | Maximum number of characters per text chunk | `800` | ❌ |

## 🧩 Chunking Strategy

This project uses LangChain's **`RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`** to divide extracted PDF text into semantically meaningful chunks.

### Configuration

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| `chunk_size` | **800** | Balances context richness with LLM token limits. Large enough to capture a full paragraph, small enough for precise retrieval. |
| `chunk_overlap` | **150** | Ensures sentences at chunk boundaries aren't lost. Prevents context fragmentation at split points. |

### How It Works

The splitter attempts to divide text using a **hierarchical separator strategy**, falling back to the next level only when the current separator doesn't produce chunks within the size limit:

```
1. "\n\n"  →  Paragraph boundaries (preferred)
2. "\n"    →  Line breaks
3. ". "    →  Sentence boundaries
4. " "     →  Word boundaries (last resort)
```

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Raw PDF Text] --> B{Split by<br/>paragraphs}
    B -->|Chunk ≤ 800| C[✅ Keep chunk]
    B -->|Chunk > 800| D{Split by<br/>line breaks}
    D -->|Chunk ≤ 800| C
    D -->|Chunk > 800| E{Split by<br/>sentences}
    E -->|Chunk ≤ 800| C
    E -->|Chunk > 800| F{Split by<br/>words}
    F --> C

    C --> G[Add 150-char<br/>overlap]
    G --> H[Final Chunks]

    style C fill:#2ecc71,stroke:#27ae60,color:#fff
    style H fill:#3498db,stroke:#2980b9,color:#fff
```

### Why These Values?

- **800 characters** ≈ 150–200 tokens — fits comfortably within the context window while providing enough surrounding text for coherent answers.
- **150-character overlap** ensures that if a key sentence falls at a chunk boundary, it appears in both adjacent chunks, preventing information loss during retrieval.

## 🧬 Embedding Model Choice

### Model: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`

This project uses the [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) sentence transformer from Hugging Face for generating document and query embeddings.

| Property | Value |
|:---|:---|
| **Dimensions** | 384 |
| **Model Size** | ~80 MB |
| **Max Sequence Length** | 256 tokens |
| **Similarity Metric** | Cosine similarity (normalized embeddings) |
| **Execution** | 100% local — runs on CPU, no API calls |
| **Performance** | ~14,000 sentences/sec on modern CPU |

### Why This Model?

| Criterion | all-MiniLM-L6-v2 | OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Cost** | Free (local) | $0.02 / 1M tokens |
| **Privacy** | Data never leaves your machine | Data sent to OpenAI servers |
| **Latency** | ~2ms per embedding | ~100ms per embedding (network) |
| **Quality** | Excellent for retrieval tasks | Slightly higher benchmark scores |
| **Dimensions** | 384 | 1536 |
| **Offline** | ✅ Works without internet | ❌ Requires API access |

> [!NOTE]
> For most document Q&A use cases, `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` provides an excellent quality-to-cost ratio. The marginal accuracy improvement from OpenAI embeddings rarely justifies the added cost, latency, and privacy trade-offs.

## 🔍 Retrieval Strategy

The chatbot employs a **hybrid retrieval** approach that combines vector similarity search with keyword-based reranking for maximum relevance.

### Pipeline

```mermaid
graph TD
    Q[User Question] --> E[Embed Query<br/>all-MiniLM-L6-v2]
    E --> VS[Vector Similarity Search<br/>ChromaDB · Cosine Distance]
    VS --> |Top-k candidates| RR[Keyword Reranking<br/>BM25-style overlap scoring]
    Q --> RR
    RR --> DD[Deduplication<br/>Remove redundant chunks]
    DD --> TOP[Top-k = 5<br/>Final Context]
    TOP --> LLM[LLM Prompt Assembly]

    style VS fill:#3498db,stroke:#2980b9,color:#fff
    style RR fill:#e67e22,stroke:#d35400,color:#fff
    style TOP fill:#2ecc71,stroke:#27ae60,color:#fff
```

### How It Works

| Stage | Method | Purpose |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **1. Vector Search** | Cosine similarity on 384-dim embeddings | Captures semantic meaning — finds contextually relevant chunks even with different wording |
| **2. Keyword Reranking** | BM25-style term overlap scoring | Boosts chunks that contain exact query terms — important for names, numbers, and technical terms |
| **3. Reciprocal Rank Fusion** | `1 / (k + rank)` score combination | Merges rankings from both methods into a single unified score |
| **4. Deduplication** | Content hash comparison | Removes near-duplicate chunks that may appear due to overlapping splits |
| **5. Top-k Selection** | Return top 5 chunks | Provides enough context for accurate answers without overwhelming the LLM's context window |

> [!TIP]
> Adjust `TOP_K_RESULTS` in your `.env` file. Use `3` for faster responses with simpler documents, or `7–10` for dense technical papers.

## 📝 Prompt Design

### System Prompt

```text
You are a helpful AI assistant that answers questions based ONLY on the provided 
document context. Follow these rules strictly:

1. Answer questions using ONLY the information found in the context below.
2. If the context does not contain enough information to answer the question, 
   say "I don't have enough information in the uploaded documents to answer 
   this question."
3. NEVER make up or hallucinate information that is not in the context.
4. When referencing information, cite the source document and page number.
5. Be concise but thorough in your answers.
6. If the question is a greeting or general conversation, respond naturally 
   but remind the user that you specialize in answering questions about their 
   uploaded documents.
```

### Context Template

```text
Context from uploaded documents:
---
{context_chunks}
---

Each chunk above is labeled with its source file and page number. 
Use these labels when citing sources in your answer.

Conversation History:
{chat_history}

User Question: {question}
```

### Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|:---|:---|
| **No Hallucination Guard** | Explicit instruction to answer ONLY from provided context. If context is insufficient, the model admits it rather than guessing. |
| **Source Referencing** | Chunks are labeled with filename + page number; the model is instructed to cite these labels. |
| **Context-Only Answers** | The system prompt forbids external knowledge, ensuring all answers are grounded in the uploaded documents. |
| **Conversational Awareness** | Chat history is included so the model can resolve pronouns and follow-up questions correctly. |
